# Night at a windmill
This is my project for a course in Computer Graphics held at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.
I used the project skeleton located at https://github.com/matf-racunarska-grafika/project_base.git and used materials found on https://learnopengl.com/, https://sketchfab.com, https://free3d.com and other similar sites on the internet.
A video showcasing the project is available on the following link https://youtu.be/g1NPq-zd7g0.

# Instructions
1. `git clone https://github.com/dimitrije-24/computer-graphics-project.git`
2. CLion -> Open -> path/to/my/project_base
3. Main is located at src/main.cpp
4. Cpp files go in the src directory
5. Header (h and hpp) files go in the include directory
6. Shaders are located in `resources/shaders`. Vertex shaders have the `.vs` extension, fragment shaders have the `.fs` extension
7. ALT+SHIFT+F10 -> project_base -> run

# Commands
- `W` `A` `S` `D` - keys for moving around the scene
- `F` - turns the flashlight on and off
- `B` - toggles between Blinn-Phong and Phong reflection models
- `V` - toggles the bloom effect
- `Q` - brings the exposer down
- `E` - brings the exposer up
- `O` - sets the exposer at 1.0
- `ESC` - exits the program

# Implemented subjects
- Everything covered in the first 8 weeks of lectures + Blending, Face Culling and Advnace Lighting
- Cubemaps
- HDR, Bloom
